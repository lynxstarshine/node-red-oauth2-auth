# node-red-oauth2-auth

This package is a forked of the project of Ralf Uhlig that you can see find here: "https://github.com/RalfUhlig/node-red-contrib-oauth2-auth#readme"

The change that have been made is the implementation of the RFC 7636 for the PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange)

OAuth2 client for getting oauth2 credentials by the authorization flow to use in other nodes. Credentials are automatically refreshed on expiration. After a successful authorization, the msg object has a new element *bearerToken* with the value **Bearer**Â *access token*. This element can be used of the authentication e.g. in the htmlRequest node. 

I liked to have an indepentent implementation of the oauth2 authentication flow. 
Inspired by https://github.com/node-red/node-red-web-nodes/tree/master/google, I implemented this node in a similar way.
Maybe it's useful for others. Up to now, there are no releases.
